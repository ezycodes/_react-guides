## tell me about yourself
- my name is EZ. 

- Over the years,  I have built up a diverse range of skills and qualities that I believe are a match for this job description. 

- I am very positive. I love being at work. I have goals outside of work, which means that I need to perform to a high standard when I'm in my job in order to achieve those goals. 
So I'm very focused in my work. 
- I'm very good at planning and organizing my work. 
-So you can give me loads of tasks and different projects to work on, and they will always be done on time and to the necessary standard. 
- I'm very good with clients and customers because I understand for your business to be successful, 
 
<!-- I need to not only act as a positive role model, but I need to provide outstanding service. 
 So your customers and clients come back to your business time and time again.  -->
 
- I am happy working on my own, but I also like to work as part of a team.

- I'm a very fast learner, so if you give me a task, I will learn it quickly.

<!-- I'll always be the first person to volunteer to do a job that needs to be done. And you have my word that if you hire me in this position, I will perform to a very high standard and I will help you to achieve your commercial and your financial objectives.  -->
<!--    
That's great. Thank you. Could you tell us a little bit why you want to work here with us? Yes.  -->

## why you want to work here with us? 

- So I've been aware of your organization for many years. As you know, you are a market leader, you are innovative and you are creative. And I believe from what I've seen, you always put your customers and clients first. 
   
- So you start with your customers and then you work backwards, which in my opinion, will always mean that you are going to be successful. That is good for me because I am working in an organization that is constantly striving and moving forward and more importantly, you want to improve and develop. 

- I'm the type of person who also wants to improve and develop. I don't just want to sit in a job and do the bare minimum. I want to excel and advance year on year. 
   


- I'm also at the stage in my career where I see myself staying with the same organization for a long period of time. And because from what I understand during my research, you have very ambitious plans for the future and I would like to be a part of those. 
   
<!-- Finally, I understand that you hire lots of talented and bright people. So again, that's good for me because I will get to work alongside some people who will push me and they will challenge me and that's great for my long term future career plans.  -->
   
<!-- So those are the main reasons I see myself being here for a long period of time and I will be able to grow as your company grows as well.  -->
   
<!-- Thank you. Richard, what experience do you have which is relevant to this role? Before I applied for the position, I downloaded a copy of the job description. 
    -->
<!-- I read it to make sure that I was confident I could meet the requirements of the role. Predominantly, the experience I have is first and foremost dealing with customers and clients.  -->
   
<!-- I am very, very good at that. I have lots of experience. I used to do it on a daily basis in previous roles. So if a client is demanding or they are difficult, I have the interpersonal skills and the communication skills to win them over and make sure that we provide them with a first class service. 
   
I also have lots of experience working in a variety of different teams. So you could say to me, Richard, we want you to go and work in a team. I may have never worked with those people before, but I will adapt, I will support the team members and I will make sure that we all focus on achieving our objectives.  -->
   
<!-- Other experience I have is being able to plan and organize my work methodically. I am very good at working under pressure. I enjoy working on the stress. -->
